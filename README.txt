Spring 2016

Prog1: Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs)
Implemented Kruskal's algorithm to find MST from randomly generated graphs.

Prog2: Strassen's Algorithm
Implemented Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication. Optimized to find ideal cross-over point between Strassen's and conventional O(n^3) algorithm.

Prog3: Number Partition Problem
Examined the number partition problem using dynamic programming, the Karmarkar-Karp algorithm, and various heuristics including repeated random, hill climbing, and simulated annealing.
